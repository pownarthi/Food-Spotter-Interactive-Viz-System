# Food-Spotter-Interactive-Viz-System
Food Spotter Interactive Visualization System a visual analytics system that analyzes the user generated reviews in Yelp to recommend best dishes to try out 
at a given restaurant with an option for the users to infer the popularity of restaurants across compelling categories 
such as price, service, food, ambience and deals.

One can find a detailed report about the system here.

I am currently working on cleaning the code to post in github. Please visit soon for the code.
